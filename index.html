                <p class="text-center text-xl p-7 font-semibold">Virat Kohli was born on 5 November 1988 in Delhi
                    to a Punjabi Hindu family. His father, Prem Kohli, worked as a criminal lawyer and his mother, Saroj
                    Kohli, served as a housewife. He has an older brother, Vikas, and an older sister, Bhawna. Kohli's
                    formative years were spent in the Uttam Nagar and commenced his early education at Vishal Bharti
                    Public School. According to his family, Kohli exhibited an early affinity for cricket as a mere
                    three-year-old. He would pick up a cricket bat, display natural skill, and request his father to
                    bowl to him.</p>

               <p class="text-xl font-medium p-6">Virat Kohli single-handedly knocked Australia out of the T20 World Cup 2016 smashing an unbeaten knock of 82 runs off just 51 balls. In acceleration for the ages, Kohli's last 33 runs came in just 13 balls as he was the dominating force in the partnership between him and the former skipper MS Dhoni</p>

                <h1 class="text-center text-lg font-extrabold">113 (47) v KXIP, Bengaluru, 2016 .</h1>
                <p class="text-xl font-medium p-6">Virat Kohli is the Player of the Match for his 50-ball 113. "When all that was happening out there, I thought surely I can't get a 100 in 15 overs. But hopefully we can continue what we have been doing. My main aim is to get runs, it doesn't matter how I play. Momentum is a big thing in T20s, when you get into the zone, you feel you can hit any ball. So you just want to give yourself. </p>

                <h1 class="text-center text-lg font-extrabold">82* (52) v Pakistan,Mumbai,2022 .</h1>
                <p class="text-xl font-medium p-6">Many regard Kohli's innings against Pakistan as the greatest T20I knock of all time, and their claim has merit; India were reeling at 31/4 in the 160-run chase but Kohli held one end, and was the aggressor in a 113-run stand alongside Hardik Pandya (40). Kohli also hit Haris Rauf for two incredible sixes off successive deliveries when India needed 28 runs off 8 deliveries to win the match. </p>
